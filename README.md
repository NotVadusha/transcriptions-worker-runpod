# transcriptions-worker-runpod

A [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io/) **serverless** worker that transcribes audio with
**NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6B v2** (via the [NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) ASR
toolkit) and returns transcript text plus word- and segment-level timestamps.

- **Input:** a presigned HTTPS URL to an audio/video file.
- **Output:** transcript `text`, optional `segments`/`words` timestamps, and run `meta`.
- **Range:** a few seconds up to **10 hours** of audio. Short clips run in a single pass;
  long files use a local-attention + overlapping-chunk path with timestamp stitching.
- **English-only, batch (non-streaming)** for v0. No diarization, no multilingual, no auth/billing.

The worker stores **no cloud credentials**. It pulls audio from a caller-provided presigned
GET URL and, for large results, PUTs them to a caller-provided presigned PUT URL.

Root `handler.py` only starts RunPod and delegates to `src.handler`. The worker
orchestration stays in `src/handler.py`, and all model logic lives in `transcribe.py`,
which is the only module that imports NeMo/torch.

## Version stack & container

The image is based on the **official NVIDIA NeMo container**. It ships a pre-validated,
mutually-compatible PyTorch + CUDA + NeMo triple with Hopper/Blackwell support — the
lowest-risk way to stay compatible with the latest GPUs (Blackwell B200 / RTX 5090 require
CUDA 12.8+ and PyTorch ≥ 2.7).

### Pinned base image

```dockerfile
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:25.09.02
```

This is the conservative-stable pin. Its published software-component table lists:

| Property | Value (baked into the base image) |
|---|---|
| NeMo | 2.5.0 |
| PyTorch | 2.8.0a0 |
| CUDA | 12.9.1 |
| Python | 3.12 *(inferred — must be confirmed on GPU, see below)* |
| Blackwell support | Yes (CUDA 12.9 + PyTorch 2.8) |

> **Why not `25.11.01`?** The NeMo changelog states *"NeMo 2 will be deprecated starting 25.11."*
> `25.11.01` (NeMo 2.6.0 / torch 2.9.0a0 / CUDA 13.0.1) sits exactly on that boundary and may
> carry ASR API churn. `25.09.02` still satisfies the Blackwell / CUDA 12.8+ requirement while
> staying one release back. Do **not** use the `26.02` tag yet — its resolved versions are not in
> NVIDIA's component table.

### Record the *resolved* versions (must validate on GPU)

The table above is what NVIDIA publishes; the numbers are partly inferred. Before trusting the
image in production, run inside the pulled container on the target GPU and **paste the output back
into this section**:

```bash
python3 --version
python3 -c "import torch; print('torch', torch.__version__, 'cuda', torch.version.cuda); \
            print('capability', torch.cuda.get_device_capability())"
python3 -c "import nemo; print('nemo', nemo.__version__)"
ffmpeg -version | head -1          # confirm ffmpeg present
ldconfig -p | grep sndfile         # confirm libsndfile present
```

```text
# RESOLVED VERSIONS (fill in from the container on the deploy GPU):
# Python  : __________
# torch   : __________   CUDA: __________
# device  : sm_____  (e.g. sm_100 B200 / sm_120 RTX 5090)
# NeMo    : __________
# ffmpeg  : present? ____   libsndfile: present? ____
```

`ffmpeg` and `libsndfile1` presence in the NeMo image is **undocumented**, so the Dockerfile
installs both explicitly — still confirm with the commands above.

### Registry auth

`nvcr.io` requires login even though the NeMo image is publicly pullable:

```bash
docker login nvcr.io
# Username: $oauthtoken
# Password: <your NGC API key>
```

On RunPod, set these under the template's **container registry credentials**. The image is large
(~20 GB+ for this NeMo generation) — expect long cold pulls and size the RunPod container
disk / network volume accordingly.

### CUDA-base fallback

If the full NeMo image is too large or slow to cold-start, fall back to a CUDA/PyTorch base and
install NeMo yourself (must keep CUDA 12.8+ / torch ≥ 2.7 for Blackwell):

```dockerfile
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.09-py3
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ffmpeg libsndfile1 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN pip install -U "nemo_toolkit[asr]" runpod
```

You then own NeMo/torch compatibility (a real risk on Blackwell). Note in this README which path
was taken.

---

## Build & deploy

### Build and push the image

```bash
docker login nvcr.io                       # see "Registry auth" above
docker build -t <registry>/transcriptions-worker-runpod:latest .
docker push  <registry>/transcriptions-worker-runpod:latest
```

The Dockerfile bakes the model weights into the image (a prefetch step that calls
`from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)`) so cold starts don't re-download the ~2.4 GB checkpoint.

### Create the RunPod endpoint

1. RunPod console → **Serverless** → **New Endpoint**.
2. Point it at the pushed image; add the `nvcr.io` registry credentials to the template.
3. **GPU type:** start on A10 / L4 / RTX 4090 (good price/perf for a 0.6B model). The image also
   runs on Blackwell-class GPUs (B200 / RTX 5090) via the base above. Make this configurable and
   capture cost/throughput per GPU in the benchmark so the production choice is data-driven.
4. Set any env overrides from the [env var table](#configuration-env-vars) (defaults are fine for v0).
5. Size container disk for the large image and the baked model.

The worker loads the model **once at container boot** (RunPod best practice) so it persists across
warm invocations.

---

## Local testing

### GPU-free unit tests

The pure-logic modules (`config`, `schemas`, `chunking`, and the `audio`/`storage` wrappers) are
unit-tested **without a GPU or NeMo**. They pass under Python 3.13 with only stdlib + pytest:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest                 # pyproject.toml sets pythonpath=["."] so `from src import ...` resolves
```

These cover request validation, output shaping, chunk planning, timestamp offset/stitch math,
download/ffmpeg error mapping, and result-offload behavior — i.e. acceptance criteria that don't
need a model.

### Running the handler locally

The RunPod SDK loads `tests/test_input.json` automatically:

```bash
# Tests import the worker without a GPU via the test-only escape hatch:
SKIP_MODEL_LOAD=1 python handler.py
```

`tests/test_input.json`:

```json
{ "input": { "audio_url": "https://dldata-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2086-149220-0033.wav", "return_timestamps": true } }
```

Or pass input inline (takes precedence over the file):

```bash
python handler.py --test_input '{"input": {"audio_url": "https://.../clip.wav"}}'
```

> `SKIP_MODEL_LOAD=1` is a **test-only** escape hatch: `transcribe.load_model()` returns
> immediately without importing NeMo/torch, so `handler.py` imports on a machine with no GPU.
> An actual transcription still needs a real model — never set this in production.
>
> Note: `runpod.serverless.progress_update(...)` does **not** deliver in pure-local
> `python handler.py` runs; validate progress under `--rp_serve_api` if you depend on it.

---

## Self-host on your own GPU

The RunPod SDK can expose the handler as a local FastAPI server with the same `/run`, `/runsync`,
and `/status` routes the cloud endpoint provides — handy for running the worker on your own GPU box:

```bash
python handler.py --rp_serve_api --rp_api_host 0.0.0.0 --rp_api_port 8000
```

Flags (from the RunPod SDK):

- `--rp_serve_api` — start the local API server.
- `--rp_api_host` — bind address (default `localhost`; use `0.0.0.0` for LAN access).
- `--rp_api_port` — port (default `8000`).
- `--rp_api_concurrency` — worker concurrency (the file must be `main.py` if `> 1`).
- `--rp_log_level` — `ERROR` / `WARN` / `INFO` / `DEBUG`.

Then call it like the cloud endpoint (short clips can use `/runsync`):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/runsync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {"audio_url": "https://.../clip.wav", "return_timestamps": true}}'
```

---

## Caller flow (async `/run` + polling, optional webhook)

The primary interface is **async** — a 10-hour job far exceeds any synchronous timeout, so
`/runsync` is **not** a supported path for long audio (use it only for short clips / local testing).

### Submit a job

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<ENDPOINT_ID>/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <RUNPOD_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": {
        "audio_url": "https://<presigned-GET-url>",
        "return_timestamps": true,
        "result_upload_url": "https://<presigned-PUT-url>"
      }}'
# -> { "id": "<JOB_ID>", "status": "IN_QUEUE" }
```

### Poll for the result

```bash
curl https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<ENDPOINT_ID>/status/<JOB_ID> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <RUNPOD_API_KEY>"
# status: IN_QUEUE -> IN_PROGRESS -> COMPLETED (output present) | FAILED
```

While running, the worker may emit `progress_update` messages (e.g. `"Transcribed 3/8 chunks"`)
that appear in the `status` response.

### Webhook (optional)

Add a `webhook` URL to the submit body to be notified on completion instead of polling:

```bash
-d '{"input": { ... }, "webhook": "https://your-server.example.com/runpod-callback"}'
```

RunPod POSTs the final job object (same shape as the `/status` payload) to that URL when the job
finishes.

---

## Request / response schemas

### Request (`job["input"]`)

```jsonc
{
  "audio_url": "https://...",          // REQUIRED. Presigned HTTPS GET URL to the audio file.
  "return_timestamps": true,           // OPTIONAL, default true. If false, omit segments & words.
  "language": "en",                    // OPTIONAL, default "en". v0 accepts only "en".
  "result_upload_url": "https://..."   // OPTIONAL. Presigned HTTPS PUT URL for large-result offload.
}
```

Validation rules (see `schemas.parse_request`):

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| `audio_url` missing / not a string | error `MISSING_AUDIO_URL` |
| `audio_url` scheme not `https` (or empty host) | error `INVALID_URL` |
| `return_timestamps` not a boolean | coerced to `true` (does **not** fail) |
| `language` present and not in supported set (`{"en"}`) | error `UNSUPPORTED_LANGUAGE` |
| `result_upload_url` present and not an `https` URL | error `INVALID_URL` |

### Success response (inline)

Returned directly when the serialized output is under `RESULT_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD_BYTES`:

```jsonc
{
  "text": "Full transcript with punctuation and capitalization.",
  "segments": [                                   // present only if return_timestamps=true
    { "start": 0.0, "end": 5.2, "text": "First segment text." }
  ],
  "words": [                                      // present only if return_timestamps=true
    { "start": 0.1, "end": 0.4, "word": "Hello" }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "model": "nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2",
    "language": "en",
    "audio_duration_sec": 123.4,
    "processing_time_sec": 8.1,
    "rtf": 15.235,                                // see "RTF" below
    "chunked": false,                             // true if the long-audio path was used
    "num_chunks": 1,
    "worker_version": "0.1.0"
  }
}
```

- `text` is **always** present.
- `segments` and `words` are present **only** when `return_timestamps` is `true`. When `false`,
  both keys are **omitted entirely** (not `null`, not `[]`).
- Timestamps are floats in **seconds**, relative to the start of the full audio (after stitching for
  chunked runs).

#### RTF

`rtf` is defined as:

```text
rtf = audio_duration_sec / processing_time_sec
```

It is a **speed factor** — higher is faster (e.g. `15.0` means 15× real-time). When
`processing_time_sec <= 0`, `rtf` is reported as `0.0`. The benchmark uses this same convention.
(NVIDIA's "RTFx" uses the same speed-factor direction; the benchmark also reports the inverse
`processing_time / audio_duration` and labels which is which.)

### Offloaded response (large results)

A 10-hour transcript with full word timestamps can exceed RunPod's payload caps
(`/run` = **10 MB**, `/runsync` = **20 MB**). When the serialized output exceeds
`RESULT_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD_BYTES` (~8 MB, safely under the 10 MB cap) **and** a `result_upload_url`
was provided, the worker PUTs the **full** §3.2 object as JSON to that URL and returns a small
reference instead:

```jsonc
{
  "result_url": "https://...",         // the PUT location, with the query string stripped
  "text": "...",                       // full transcript kept inline (small relative to timestamps)
  "meta": { ... },                     // always inline
  "offloaded": true                    // words & segments live in the uploaded JSON, not inline
}
```

The uploaded JSON file **is** the complete inline success object (with `words`/`segments`).

> `result_url` is the **object location** with the presigned **signature stripped** (the signature is
> a secret and is never echoed back). To fetch the stored JSON, the caller uses its own
> presigned/authenticated GET for that object — it generated the PUT URL, so it can generate a GET.

### Error response

Validation and known failures are returned as the job **output** (the job still completes):

```jsonc
{ "error": { "code": "INVALID_URL", "message": "audio_url must be an https URL." } }
```

Genuinely unexpected failures (e.g. CUDA OOM, model load failure → `TranscriptionError`) are
**raised** so RunPod marks the job `FAILED`.

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `MISSING_AUDIO_URL` | `audio_url` missing or not a string |
| `INVALID_URL` | `audio_url` or `result_upload_url` not a valid `https` URL |
| `DOWNLOAD_FAILED` | download non-2xx, timeout, connection error, or over `MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES` |
| `UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT` | ffmpeg cannot decode the input (normalize failed) |
| `UNSUPPORTED_LANGUAGE` | `language` other than `en` in v0 |
| `AUDIO_TOO_LONG` | probed duration exceeds `MAX_AUDIO_SECONDS` (default 10 h) |
| `FFMPEG_FAILED` | ffprobe/ffmpeg failed for a non-decode reason (e.g. window extraction) |
| `TRANSCRIPTION_FAILED` | inference error — **raised**, job marked `FAILED` |
| `RESULT_TOO_LARGE` | output over threshold but **no** `result_upload_url` provided |
| `RESULT_UPLOAD_FAILED` | the PUT to `result_upload_url` failed: a 4xx/3xx, or a 5xx/transport error after retries (the worker retries transient 5xx/transport failures up to 3× before giving up) |

> **`RESULT_TOO_LARGE`** is returned (not raised) when the result exceeds the offload threshold and
> the caller did not supply a `result_upload_url`. The worker never silently truncates — for
> large/long audio you **must** pass a presigned PUT URL.

---

## How long audio is handled

- **Short path** (`duration <= SINGLE_PASS_MAX_SEC`, default 1440 s / 24 min): one
  `transcribe([wav], timestamps=True)` call with the model's default global attention.
- **Long path** (`duration > SINGLE_PASS_MAX_SEC`): split the WAV into overlapping windows
  (`CHUNK_SEC` with `CHUNK_OVERLAP_SEC` overlap), transcribe each, then stitch. Chunks whose
  length is at or below `SINGLE_PASS_MAX_SEC` use the model's default global attention for better
  accuracy in `balanced`/`best` mode. `fast` mode, and larger chunk windows, use local windowed
  attention (`rel_pos_local_attn [128,128]` + conv-chunking factor) to bound VRAM.

**Stitching / dedup rule** (unit-tested in `tests/test_chunking.py`): each chunk's chunk-local
timestamps are offset to absolute time by its start; in the overlap region between chunks, a token
is kept by whichever chunk **owns** that time, where ownership boundaries are the midpoints of the
overlap regions. A token is kept by chunk *i* iff its center `(start+end)/2` falls in chunk *i*'s
ownership window. This guarantees no dropped or doubled words at seams.

After stitching, the worker scans for large internal transcript gaps. If a gap is at least
`GAP_RETRY_MIN_SEC`, it extracts that interval with `GAP_RETRY_PADDING_SEC` of context on both
sides, retranscribes it with global attention, and splices only tokens whose centers fall inside
the original missing interval. The response `meta` includes `gap_retry_count` and
`gap_retry_recovered` for chunked runs.

---

## Configuration (env vars)

All parsed and validated in `config.py` at startup; malformed values raise a clear `ValueError`
immediately (fail fast).

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL_NAME` | `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2` | Model to load. Only v2 is validated in v0. |
| `TRANSCRIPTION_QUALITY` | `balanced` | Preset for long-audio quality/speed. `fast` = old 20-min local-attention chunks, no gap retry. `balanced` = 5-min global-attention chunks + gap retry. `best` = 3-min global-attention chunks + gap retry. Explicit chunk/retry env vars override the preset defaults. |
| `MAX_AUDIO_SECONDS` | `36000` | Reject audio longer than this (10 h) → `AUDIO_TOO_LONG`. |
| `SINGLE_PASS_MAX_SEC` | `1440` | `<=` this → single-pass; above → chunked (24 min). |
| `CHUNK_SEC` | `300` in `balanced` | Chunk length for the long-audio path. |
| `CHUNK_OVERLAP_SEC` | `20` in `balanced` | Overlap between chunks (avoids clipping words at seams). |
| `GAP_RETRY_ENABLED` | `true` in `balanced`/`best` | Retry large internal transcript gaps after initial stitching. |
| `GAP_RETRY_MIN_SEC` | `20` | Minimum timestamp gap that triggers a retry. |
| `GAP_RETRY_PADDING_SEC` | `5` | Seconds of context added before/after each retried gap. |
| `GAP_RETRY_MAX_SEC` | `300` | Skip retry windows larger than this to avoid runaway recovery jobs. |
| `DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `120` | Per-download timeout. |
| `MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES` | `2147483648` | Max audio download size (2 GB) → `DOWNLOAD_FAILED` if exceeded. |
| `RESULT_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD_BYTES` | `8000000` | Offload result above ~8 MB (under the 10 MB `/run` cap). |
| `RESULT_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `120` | Timeout for the PUT to `result_upload_url`. |
| `SKIP_MODEL_LOAD` | `false` | **Test-only.** Skip NeMo/torch import so the handler imports without a GPU. Never set in production. |

No storage credentials are configured on the worker — result offload always uses the
caller-provided presigned `result_upload_url`.

---

## Security model / trust boundary

v0 treats the **RunPod API caller as trusted** (the system operator). There is no public API
gateway, auth, or billing in front of the worker — those are explicitly out of scope. Within that
boundary the worker still takes the following precautions, and leaves a few residual risks worth
knowing about:

- **Caller-supplied URLs.** Both `audio_url` (GET) and `result_upload_url` (PUT) are caller-controlled.
  Both must be `https` (validated up front), and the worker does **not follow redirects** on either
  request. A presigned S3/GCS URL resolves directly, so this is sufficient — and not chasing
  redirects closes an SSRF path: a host that 30x-redirects to a loopback / link-local /
  cloud-metadata address (e.g. `169.254.169.254`) is never followed, and the https-only rule can't be
  bypassed on a redirect hop. A redirect surfaces as a clean `DOWNLOAD_FAILED` / `RESULT_UPLOAD_FAILED`.
- **No stored credentials.** The worker holds no cloud keys; all object access goes through the
  caller's presigned URLs. Run it with **no attachable instance/cloud-metadata credentials** and, if
  possible, restricted egress, so even a future SSRF gap has nothing to reach.
- **Presigned signatures are secrets.** They are never logged or returned: `result_url` has its query
  string stripped, and `RESULT_UPLOAD_FAILED` messages report only the object location + an HTTP
  status / exception type, never the signed URL or a raw exception string.
- **Bounded resource use.** Downloads are size-capped (`MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES`, checked against the
  advertised `Content-Length` *and* mid-stream) and timeout-bounded (`DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_SEC`).
- **Residual risks (v0):** the SSRF guard is "don't follow redirects" rather than a full
  resolve-and-block-private-ranges check — a caller that passes a direct `https://<internal-host>/`
  URL is not blocked (it must still present a valid https endpoint). `DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_SEC` is
  per-socket-operation, so a very slow trickle is bounded by the size cap rather than a hard total
  deadline. If you later expose this worker to untrusted callers, add a redirect/target
  address-range guard and a total-download deadline.

## Acceptance-criteria mapping

| # | Criterion (SPEC §11) | Where it's satisfied |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Image with weights baked in; model loaded once at boot | `Dockerfile` prefetch step; `transcribe.load_model()` called at `handler.py` import |
| 2 | Short clip returns §3.2 shape with non-empty `text`, monotonic `segments`, in-range `words` | `transcribe.run` single-pass + `schemas.build_output` |
| 3 | `return_timestamps: false` omits `segments` & `words` | `schemas.build_output` (keys omitted) |
| 4 | ~30-min file via chunked path, `chunked=true`, correctly stitched | `transcribe.run` long path + `chunking.stitch` |
| 5 | File > `MAX_AUDIO_SECONDS` → `AUDIO_TOO_LONG` | `handler.py` duration gate |
| 6 | Bad/missing/non-https URL & undecodable file → correct structured error | `schemas.parse_request`, `audio.download`/`normalize`, `handler.py` catches |
| 7 | Over-threshold output → `result_url` + `offloaded:true`; no URL → `RESULT_TOO_LARGE` | `storage.maybe_offload` |
| 8 | `meta` fully populated; `rtf` matches definition | `schemas.build_output` |
| 9 | `test_chunking.py` & `test_schemas.py` pass without a GPU | `pytest` (this repo) |
| 10 | Benchmark runs end-to-end, emits CSV + summary | `benchmark/` harness |
